Our neighborhood’s new GreenTech Hub is thriving! Volunteers can sign up at https://greentech-community.org/signup or call our coordination team +2013456789544 for inquiries.
The project uses IoT sensors (accessible via http://192.168.1.55/dashboard) to monitor soil health, and live data streams are hosted at http://files.greentech.net/weather_reports.

We’ve also launched a fun scavenger hunt! Find hidden QR codes linked to 172.16.254.1, but watch out for the malicious IP 186.29.23.1 planted as a decoy.
